      There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as
      yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of
      all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come
      again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they
      may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the
      Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
    </p>
    <p>
      We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
      and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
      hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
      energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to
      accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,
      and the others, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our
      efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important
      decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the
      Presidency.

      In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the
      greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the
      ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster
      rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn,
      generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators
      on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one
      as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered
      together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building
      to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as
      a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.
